1. Describe Flutter and its key features.
Flutter is a framework for building mobile applications that offers high-performance, visually appealing, and cross-platform solutions with a single codebase. It stands out due to its utilization of Dart, a language designed for client-side development, a rich set of customizable widgets for creating beautiful UI, a reactive programming model enabling real-time updates, and a hot reload feature facilitating instant viewing of code changes.

2. Can you explain Dart's role within Flutter?
Dart serves as the programming language for Flutter, chosen for its optimization for client-side development, ease of learning, and compilation speed compared to interpreted languages like JavaScript. It boasts a sound type system, simplifying large-scale application development.

3. Discuss the two main types of widgets in Flutter.
Flutter employs two types of widgets: stateless and stateful. Stateless widgets, such as static text labels or icons, remain immutable once created, suitable for elements that don't require frequent updates. Stateful widgets, like forms or lists, possess mutable properties and update dynamically based on user interactions or other events.

4. Differentiate between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget.
StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget are widget types in Flutter. StatelessWidget remains unaltered after creation and is suitable for static UI components like Text or Icons. Conversely, StatefulWidget's properties can change, making it ideal for interactive elements like TextField or Checkbox.

5. Explain the significance of a key in Flutter.
